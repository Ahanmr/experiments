# Experiments
Collection of my web compatible experiments.

### 1. Illusion with Circles #1
There's a big circle whose radius can be controlled, on it there are small circles equally distributed whose numbers and radii can be controlled as well. 
Points are rotating on each of those small circles and are connected by lines creating illusion of 3D at default parameters that I chose.

### 2. WaveOps
An educational thing where user can listen to various waves, play with their parameters, perform addition and multiplication operations on two waves.
See Inputs and Outputs in TIme Domain as well as Frequency Domain. 

### 3. Starfield
A simple 3D Starfield illusion in 2D. Speed of stars coming towards user can be controlled by X location of Mouse.

### 4. Bouncing Balls
A simple implementation of 2D physics : A ball appears and starts bouncing wherever the user clicks + drags.

### 5. SHM? *smh*
Okay, so if you want to imagine this one with only discription, then start imagining this:
There are X and Y axes..and there are two points - one able to move only along X axis and another only along Y, I named them 'anchors'.
Both of those anchors undergo their separate Simple Harmonic Motions, their individual angular speeds, amplitudes, etc can be controlled on the fly.
Then on a line joining those two, there's a point which divides the line segment joining those anchors in some ratio, say m1: m2.
In GUI controls, m1 and m2 would've been confusing for someone who didn't read description, so I named those control labels as Proximities from anchors.
