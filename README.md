### 1. Illusion with Circles #1
There's a big circle whose radius can be controlled, on it there are small circles equally distributed whose numbers and radii can be controlled as well. 
Points are rotating on each of those small circles and are connected by lines creating illusion of 3D at default parameters that I chose.
